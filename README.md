Analyzing Netflix data to uncover trends in movies and TV shows.

# Netflix EDA Project 🎬

## 📖 Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Netflix Titles dataset to uncover interesting patterns and trends in Netflix's content library.  
The analysis covers various aspects such as the type of content (Movies vs TV Shows), ratings, duration, release years, and country-wise distribution.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Removed missing values from important columns like `type`, `release_year`, `rating`, `country`, and `duration`.
- Extracted numeric values from the duration column for analysis.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** — for data cleaning and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** — for data visualization  

## 📊 Visualizations & Insights
1. **Movies vs TV Shows**  
   A bar chart showing the number of movies and TV shows available on Netflix.  
   → Movies dominate the platform.

2. **Content Ratings**  
   A pie chart visualizing the percentage of Netflix content by rating category.

3. **Movie Duration Distribution**  
   A histogram displaying how movie durations are distributed.  
   → Most movies are around 90–120 minutes long.

4. **Releases Over the Years**  
   A scatter plot showing the number of shows released each year.  
   → Netflix's content growth increased sharply after 2015.

5. **Top 10 Contributing Countries**  
   A horizontal bar chart of the countries that produced the most Netflix titles.  
   → The US leads by a wide margin.

6. **Movies vs TV Shows Over Time**  
   A line plot comparing how many movies and TV shows were released per year.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add advanced visualizations using **Seaborn** or **Plotly**.  
- Combine multiple datasets (like IMDb ratings) for deeper insights.  
- Automate visual reports using **Power BI** or **Tableau**.
